Remember that the process of putting together this demo is important. Issues like:

how are the codes built, dependencies
proprietary codes

Should work on a laptop: linux and macOS

Keep in this repo:
    notebooks
    codes? 
    
Instructions for building codes

Configure

for simex: make sure demos all still work.
Demos should have educational value.
