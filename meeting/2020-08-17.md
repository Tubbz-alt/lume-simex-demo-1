# 2020 August 17


Chris, Paul, Adrian, Jacek, Jun, Hugo. 

September 10-11 Virtual N-way. 
We have a slot to talk about simulations: 25 min. Should push for end-end sim over the next 2-3 weeks. 

1) Injector:     Astra (Chris, done. ) -> openPMD-beamphysics
2) Accelerator:  openPMD-beamphysics->elegant (Chris, nearly done) ->openPMD-beamphysics
3) FEL: openPMD-beamphysics-> genesis beam_file -> lume-genesis v4(Jacek) -> openPMD-wavefront
4) X-ray optics: openPMD-wavefront -> simple beamline (TXI toy model) WPG (Jun) -> openPMD-wavefront??
5) Sample interaction: openPMD-wavefront-> temporal profile (pysingfel) -> toy example using form factors without radiation damage -> diffraction pattern
6) Detector response: diffraction pattern -> detector pattern
7) Reconstruction/Analysis: detector pattern -> (Chuck, Jun) -> figure for presentation. 

1,2 are written in a tech note. 
3 Jacek
4 Jacek and Jun prototyped this in WPG. Chris, Jun, Jacek should meet on June 26 (Wed) after the wavefront meeting. 
  Paul will check it all. 
5 is valid when the sample is much smaller than the beam size. 
  Should start with Gaussian beam to make sure this is working. 
5,6 Chuck and Jun should work out what to do. 
7 Adrian will coordinate this. 

We need a story on how this goes from demonstration -> tool. 

Message to N-way: this is not a closed club. 

openPMD-wavefront needs another iteration, not necessary for above to work.
Chris will meet with Axel Huebel. 


# TODO in 1 weeks. 

Chris: Clean up Astra, elegant sims, make beam for Jacek. Talk to Alex H. about Genesis v4. 

Jacek: On vacation this week, will meet next Wed.

Jun: Make sure wavefront can work with WPG. 

Paul: Talk to Dave Fritz about abberation data for TXI. Ask Bill Schlotter to join us sometime. 

Adrian:
