Chris:

    4 GeV beam, from the new LCLS 
    elegant-> openPMD-beamphyics -> genesis4_beam.h5
        will point Jacek to this on NERSC
    check in function srw_wfr_from_openpmd_wavefront to openPMD-wavefront
    upload sample DFL and h5 somewhere and give to Jun
    
Jacek:

    Try to use: lcls-lattice/genesis/version4/sc_hxr
    send Chris GitHub account
    
Alex: 
    
    Help Jacek
    Show Chris the taper tuning functions

Jun:

    Check WPG's wavefront object compared with SRW
